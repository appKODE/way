# Changelog

## 0.9.0 - 2024-03-12

* Reorganize flow finish handling. Instead of specifying flow finish handler along with the target FlowNodes must now explicitly handle finish events which are sent by the child flows. Child finish event request classes are generated by the library. See sample project for examples
* Add preliminary support for `AbsoluteTarget`s. A helpers for generating such targets will be added in the next release, after testing

## 0.8.11 - 2024-02-21

* Fix issues with EnqueueEvent which was not always working

## 0.8.10 - 2023-11-01

* Fix issue with incorrect target resolution. Make code generator to generate segments having have a unique id (internally)

## 0.8.9 - 2023-10-16

## 0.8.8 - 2023-10-05

* Generated node builder factories now have an argument corresponding to the flow parameter (if any)

## 0.8.4 - 2023-06-28

* Add support for extending nodes through composition: provide `NodeExtensions` mechanism
* Add basic support for animated transitions in `NodeHost` for `way-compose` 
* Implement node hooks as one of `NodeExtension`s. Use `BaseFlowNode`, `BaseScreenNode` classes to take advantage of node hooks 
* Remove excessive logging in `way-gradle-plugin`

## 0.8.1 - 2023-03-01
